Zettix.com Front Page Development : Carousel

Web page 3D diorama.

This is semi-interactive eye candy meant to create a mood with
lighting and animation, a 3D front page to greet visitors.

A dark hall or space, like an aquarium, with turquoise glass wrapped
screens depicting top Alexa web sites slowly orbiting the area at
head level.  Iconic users hop around excitedly.

No plans to shoot rays and click the terminals, just eye candy for now. Current screenshot:

Suggested Improvements (Not really TODO):
1. Shadows.  Shadows would be great.  You need spotlights for shadows.  Yuck.
2. Add some clouds or something for a roof, the top is too empty.
