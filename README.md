Zettix.com Front Page Development : Carousel

Web page 3D diorama.

This is semi-interactive eye candy meant to create a mood with
lighting and animation, a 3D front page to greet visitors.

Users may presss arrow keys or WASD to move around.  Clicking also moves and
turns for phone support but these controls are poor so better phone support
is neeeded.  Since mostly bots visit zettix.com I'm not sure it matters.

A dark hall or space, like an aquarium, with turquoise glass wrapped
screens depicting top Alexa web sites slowly orbiting the area at
head level.  Iconic users hop around excitedly.

No plans to shoot rays and click the terminals, just eye candy for now. Current screenshot:

Suggested Improvements (Not really TODO):
1. Shadows.  Shadows would be great.  You need spotlights for shadows.  Yuck.
